=head1 DESCRIPTION

For detailed information see L<Business::OnlinePayment>.

=head1 SUPPORTED TRANSACTION TYPES

=head2 CC

Content required: type, login, action, amount, first_name, last_name, card_number, expiration.

cvv2 is required in order to get back a cvv2_response value.

=head2 Settling

To settle an authorization-only transaction (where you set action to
C<Authorization Only>), submit the C<order_number> code in the field
C<po_number> with the action set to C<Post Authorization>.

You can get the transaction id from the authorization by calling the
C<order_number> method on the object returned from the authorization.
You must also submit the amount field with a value less than or equal
to the amount specified in the original authorization.

=method BUILD

this is a before-construction hook for Moose.  You Will never call this method directly.
